## What can robots do?

Our robots pretty much can do anything doctors can. However, for the time being they only offer you services below:

* You can send them images of your skin problems and they will tell what is it and how bad is it. 📄
* They can mindread 🔮
* Robots are good at taking care of stuff. They can formulate your diets remind you to take your pills etc.

## How can I use it?
For now, our robots are just learning, attending med school day and night. Soon they will graduate and be available.
